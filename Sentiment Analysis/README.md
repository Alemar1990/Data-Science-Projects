# Objective

Objective is to extract, process and analyze data from the main social networks.

## Challenge

Complete the following tasks:

In this exercise they will have to develop a suitable model of binary classification of machine learning or deep learning (Tensorflow is recommended), to predict the sentiment of a text.
For this, a notebook must be created that contains the step by step of the construction of the model, selected described as follows:
    1. Data extraction and processing:
    	- Separate training and test data.
	- Remove special characters from the text.
    2. Model architecture.
    3. Training.
    4. Test.
    5. Storage of the model as a function for its application in other texts.

### Data

The data set has 114,265 messages previously tagged extracted from the main social networks, in order to assess the sentiment of each one of them. It is labeled as follows:
	- zero (0) if the comment is positive.
        - one (1) if the comment is negative.
