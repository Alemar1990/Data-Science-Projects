# Project

The tourism industry is changing fast and this is attracting a lot more travelers each year. The airline industry is considered as one of the most sophisticated industry in using complex pricing strategies. Now-a-days flight prices are quite unpredictable. The ticket prices change frequently. Customers are seeking to get the lowest price for their ticket, while airline companies are trying to keep their overall revenue as high as possible. Using technology it is actually possible to reduce the uncertainty of flight prices. So here we will be predicting the flight prices using efficient machine learning techniques.


In this project, The objective is to predict flight prices given the various parameters. Data used in this article is publicly available at Kaggle. This will be a regression problem since the target or dependent variable is the price (continuous numeric value).

## Data Used

Data was used from Kaggle which is a freely available platform for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts.
